The and operator returns True if both operands aree True. If one of operand is False, it returns False.

Pseudocode code:

if condition1 and condition2:
    print("All conditions are true")
else:
    print("looks like one condition is false")

The or operator return True if at least one of the operands is True. If both are False, it returns False

if condition1 or condition2:
    print("Minimum one condition is true")
else:
    print("Both conditions are false")

Both of these operators are used for logical comparisons and flow control in Python programs.


Psuecode code with example:
--------------------------

If age is greater than or equal to 18 and age is less than or equal to 35:
    Print "Eligible for job application"
Else:
    Print "Not eligible for job application"

Above pseudocode checks if the age of a person is between 18 and 35.
If the persons age falls within this range, they are eligible for the job. If not they are not eligible.

If Grade is 'A' or Grade is 'B':
    Print "Passed the exam"
Else:
    Print "Failed the exam"

pseudocode checks if the grade of student is either A or B.
If the students grade is either A or B, they have passed the exam. If not, they have failed
