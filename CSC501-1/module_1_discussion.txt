Adaptive Agile approaches offer project management solutions that prioritize flexibility, customer satisfaction,
and continuous improvement. but other traditional methods that depends on strict continuous workflows,
Agile uses repeated development to break down projects into manageable sprints.

This helps teams to work with features often by collecting feedback and work on the task quickly.
In general the teams always plan the taska and processes, encouraging the teamwork and speed decision making.
Quick collection of feedback allows fast adaptation to changing customer requirements or market requirements.
  Eg: In retail ecommerce project. Agile would allow for continious customer involvement and continuous
  release of features like product listing, recommendation, payment gateway integration etc. when trends
  changes agile helps to quickly adopt to the change.

Eg: Lets say you need to build a medical app for a hospital.
by using adaptive agile approach in practice. teams work in short sprints to release
the features focusing on the priority features required. Traditional method, required
all requirement to gather and write in a continuous order, where no product will be available
immedietly but all features will be available at once.
