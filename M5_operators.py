The and operator returns True if both operands aree True. If one of operand is False, it returns False.

Pseudocode code:

if condition1 and condition2:
    print("All conditions are true")
else:
    print("looks like one condition is false")

The or operator return True if at least one of the operands is True. If both are False, it returns False

if condition1 or condition2:
    print("Minimum one condition is true")
else:
    print("Both conditions are false")

Both of these operators are used for logical comparisons and flow control in Python programs.
